## Facebook for Myself

The Gallery of My Life:

This application shows pictures of significance to me.  When clicking upon a photo you can read a brief caption of why I chose to display the photo.  Users can also star my photos as many times as they would like - and the number of stars is shown.

This application is also available on heroku.
