## Facebook for Myself

Facebook for Myself is the first application I built using AngularJS.  While not perfect - it was a step in a great learning process!

Facebook for Myself shows pictures of significance to me.  When clicking upon a photo you can read a brief caption of why I chose to display the photo.  Users can also star my photos as many times as they would like - and the number of stars is shown.
